# Java_Chess
Play a game of chess in a Java console window.
------------------------------------------------
The driver program is titled "Game"; players should enter their desired moves in traditional chess notation.
The program will display an updated rendition of the board after each move, along with a prompt to receive the next move.
Any invalid move or incorrectly formatted move choice will cause an error message to display, asking you to reenter your desired move.
The command "Resign" can be entered at any point in the game, causing the current player to resign the game; at this point, the program will terminate.
Otherwise, the game will continue until finished, either by a decisive result, or one of the many possible "draw" conditions.
